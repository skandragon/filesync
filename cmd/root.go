maintaining digests of the contents, making a re-sync quicker than
rsync when nothing has changed.

A file, .skan-filesync, is created in the top level directory for both
the source and destination.  It holds digests and filenames, as well as
some other state like files that will be copied but not maintained,
or completely ignored.`,
